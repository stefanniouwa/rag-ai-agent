# Phase 3-5: Integration, Testing, and Deployment

## Brief Description

Complete the RAG AI Agent webapp by implementing document management features, establishing comprehensive testing coverage, setting up CI/CD pipeline, and configuring production deployment. This phase ensures the application is production-ready with proper quality assurance and deployment infrastructure.

## Phase 3: Integration and Document Management

### Files to Create:
- `src/document_manager.py` - Document CRUD operations
- `tests/test_document_manager.py` - Integration tests for document operations
- `tests/test_integration.py` - End-to-end workflow tests

### Document Management Features:
1. **List Documents**: Display all uploaded documents with metadata
2. **Delete Document**: Remove document and cascade delete all associated vectors
3. **Document Stats**: Show chunk count and storage info per document
4. **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select delete functionality

### Integration Tests:
- Upload document → verify vectors created → query document → verify citations
- Delete document → verify vectors removed → query should not return deleted content
- Chat memory persistence across sessions
- Authentication flow with protected routes

## Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

### Files to Create:
- `tests/test_e2e.py` - End-to-end Streamlit testing using selenium or streamlit-testing
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- `conftest.py` - Global test configuration
- `pytest.ini` - Pytest configuration

### Test Coverage Requirements:
- **Unit Tests**: All core functions with mocking for external APIs
- **Integration Tests**: Database operations and API interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows through Streamlit interface
- **Performance Tests**: Vector search latency and embedding generation speed

### CI/CD Pipeline:
1. **Lint and Format**: Black, isort, flake8
2. **Type Checking**: mypy for static analysis
3. **Unit Tests**: pytest with coverage reporting
4. **Integration Tests**: Test with Supabase test database
5. **Security Scanning**: bandit for security vulnerabilities

## Phase 5: Deployment and Production Setup

### Files to Create:
- `secrets.toml` - Streamlit secrets template for local development
- `README.md` - Installation and deployment instructions
- `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Optional containerization for alternative deployment

### Environment Variables Required:
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` - Supabase service role key for admin operations
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key for embeddings and chat

### Deployment Configuration:
1. **Streamlit Cloud Setup**: Configure secrets and deploy from GitHub
2. **Database Migration**: Run Supabase schema migration
3. **Environment Validation**: Verify all API connections work
4. **Performance Optimization**: Configure caching and session management

## Documentation Requirements:
- `README.md` with setup instructions and architecture overview
- API documentation for core functions
- Deployment guide for Streamlit Cloud
- Environment configuration guide
- Troubleshooting documentation

## Security Considerations:
- Environment variable security
- API key rotation procedures
- User data privacy and GDPR compliance
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Monitoring and Observability:
- Application health checks
- Error logging and monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- User analytics and usage tracking
- Cost monitoring for OpenAI API usage

## Production Readiness Checklist:
- [ ] All tests passing with >90% coverage
- [ ] Security scanning completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Deployment automation working
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

## Performance Optimization:
- Database query optimization
- Vector search index tuning
- Streamlit caching configuration
- API response time monitoring
- Memory usage optimization

## Scalability Considerations:
- Database connection pooling
- Horizontal scaling strategies
- Load testing and capacity planning
- Resource usage monitoring
- Cost optimization strategies

This final phase ensures the RAG AI Agent webapp is fully functional, well-tested, secure, and ready for production deployment with proper monitoring and maintenance procedures in place.
